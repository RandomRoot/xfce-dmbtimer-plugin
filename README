![Alt text](http://imgur.com/fomoI8jl.png "Screenshot")

Just a simple XFCE panel plugin, that shows how many days left to serve in Russian army.

## Installation

  ##### Simple: 
  Just use scripts in scripts folder :)
  
  ##### Advanced:

  1. `cd` to the directory containing the source code.

  2. `mkdir build && cd build` to create a location for building.

  3. `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..` to configure the sources.

  4. `make` to compile the plugin. This will also rerun cmake for you if
     any CMakeLists.txt files have changed.

  5. `make install` to install the plugin. This has to be done with root
     privileges if installing to system directories, but the rest of the
     build should be done with regular user privileges.

     For packaging you can optionally install the plugin into a temporary
     directory instead of the system directories by providing a DESTDIR
     variable.
